- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ratey-AtUWA, an academic teaching and researching Environmental Science at The University of Western Australia
- 👀 I’m interested in EDA, multivariate analysis (especially for data with fixed-sum closure), and spatial statistics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about spatial data analysis in the R package `sf`
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone using R in environmental (geo)chemistry, and my R coding club at my University.
- 📫 How to reach me: click my webpage link in my profile, or visit my Twitter feed (unless I #twittermigrate to Mastodon)
